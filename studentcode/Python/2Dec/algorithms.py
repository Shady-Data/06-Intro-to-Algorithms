Algorithm - descibes a computation process that halts with a solution to a problem

            There are many criteria for assessing the quality of an algorithm. The most essential criterion is correctness,
            it actually solves the problem it's meant to solve. Readability and ease of maintenance are also important qualities.
            Run-time performance is one of the most important qualities.

benchmarking -  Measure the time cost of an algorithm to obtain an actual run time.

counting -  another technique used to estimate the efficiency of an algorithm

************** Complexity Analysis **************

complexity analysis -   a method of demtermining the efficiency of algorithms that allows you to rate them independently of platform-dependent timings or impractical instruction counts

order of complexity -   The difference in performance of your algorithms

linear -    grows in direct porportion to the size of the problem

quadratic - grows as a function of the square of the problem size

logarithmic -   proportional to the log base 2 of the problem size

polynomial time algorithm - grows at a rate of n raised to the k

exponential -   a growth rate of 2 raised to the n. These are impractical to run with large problem sizes

************** Big-O Notation **************

"O" is the order of complexity

dominant -  the amount of work in an algorithm that becomes so large that you can ignore the amount of work represented by the other terms

            (1/2)n^2-(1/2)n
            n^2 is dominant here.

            Represented with Big-O notation:
            O(n^2)
